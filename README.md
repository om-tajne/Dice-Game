🎲 Dice Game

A simple web-based dice game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Each time you refresh the page, two dice are rolled randomly. The player with the higher dice value wins!

🚀 Features

Two-player dice roll simulation

Random dice images generated dynamically using JavaScript

Displays the winner (Player 1 / Player 2) or declares a tie

Lightweight and beginner-friendly project

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML → Structure of the page

CSS → Basic styling (optional enhancements)

JavaScript (DOM Manipulation) → Random number generation and updating images dynamically

📂 How It Works

When the page loads or refreshes:

JavaScript generates two random numbers between 1 and 6.

Each number is mapped to a dice image (dice1.png … dice6.png).

The images are updated dynamically in the <img> tags.

The program compares the two random numbers:

If Player 1’s number is higher → Player 1 Wins 🎉

If Player 2’s number is higher → Player 2 Wins 🏆

If both numbers are equal → It’s a Tie! 🤝
